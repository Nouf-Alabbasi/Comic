        <p> This is an interactive,
          live-on web page comic that tells a suspense,
          mystery story. A story about a family that moves into a
          new house and loses their child in it.
          The story begins when the family enters the new house to move in.
          While the parents unpack their belongings,
          they realize that their child is missing.
          The moment the child runs from the living room,
          he runs into a painting in the house that takes
          him to an amusement park. The parents start to
          call out their childâ€™s name and look for him around the house in
          different rooms. In one of the rooms, the parents see a painting,
          with a clown and a child. The moment they leave the room with the painting,
          they see a child with a creepy clown facial expression.
          They wonder is this their real child?
