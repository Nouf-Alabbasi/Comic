        <p> This is an interactive,
          live-on web page comic that tells a suspense,
          mystery story. The story is about a family that moves
          into a new house. As the parents enter their new home,
          their child sprees into the corridor, disappearing from sight.
          The parents soon begin to worry about their child and look around
          by going through the rooms. The first room
          they enter is filled with very old paintings but
          they did not pay much attention to it. Little did
          they know, in one of the paintings, their child was trapped.
          Now, the reader gets to see the perspective of the child.
          The child is in an amusement park, a very old one and he suddenly
          hears a sound far away. It belonged to a creepy clown
          holding a child and it welcomed him excitedly,
          exclaiming, "Now the fun begins, you're one of us now".
          Hearing this, the child screams for his parents,
          but soon, he was found by his parents in one of the rooms.
          The parents enquire whether he is okay, and he replies that all is
          fine - but as they leave - he transitions into the look of a clown.
          Here, we leave the reader to decide - is this their real child?
